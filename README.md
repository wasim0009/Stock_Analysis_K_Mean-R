# K-Means Clustering of Stock Data

## Overview

This project implements a **Shiny** web application to perform **K-Means clustering** on stock market data. It allows users to select multiple stocks, define a date range, and choose the number of clusters for analysis. The app visualizes the clusters, stock prices, cumulative returns, and principal component analysis (PCA), making it a useful tool for stock market analysis and clustering insights.

### Features
- **Stock Selection**: Users can choose multiple stocks from a predefined list (e.g., AAPL, AMZN, MSFT).
- **Date Range Selection**: Custom date range for analyzing stock data.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Apply K-Means clustering on the price movements (PCA reduced data).
- **Visualizations**:
  - Cluster Plot (PCA reduced data).
  - Scree Plot (Explained variance by PCA components).
  - Cluster Size Plot.
  - Adjusted Close Prices of selected stocks.
  - Cumulative Returns.
  - Correlation Heatmap of stock price movements.
  - PCA Biplot.

## How It Works
The application fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance using the `quantmod` package and applies K-means clustering on the logarithmic differences of adjusted closing prices. PCA is used for dimensionality reduction, and various visualizations help interpret the results.

### Application Workflow:
1. Select stocks and a date range.
2. Choose the number of clusters for the K-Means algorithm.
3. The app performs clustering on the selected stock data and displays the results.

### Libraries Used
- **shiny**: Web application framework for R.
- **quantmod**: Fetch and analyze stock data.
- **dplyr**: Data manipulation.
- **ggplot2**: Data visualization.
- **factoextra**: For PCA and clustering visualization.
- **corrplot**: For correlation matrix visualization.
- **shiny.semantic**: For styling the UI using Semantic UI.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have R installed, and install the following packages before running the app:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "quantmod", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "factoextra", "corrplot", "shiny.semantic"))
```

### Running the App
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kmeans-stock-analysis.git
   cd kmeans-stock-analysis
   ```
2. Open the `app.R` file in RStudio or any R environment.
3. Run the Shiny app:
   ```r
   shiny::runApp()
   ```

## Usage
- **Stock Analysis Parameters**:
  - Select multiple companies from the dropdown.
  - Define the date range for the analysis.
  - Specify the number of clusters for K-Means.
  
- **Visual Outputs**:
  - **Cluster Plot**: View the clustered stocks based on PCA-reduced data.
  - **Scree Plot**: Visualize the explained variance from the PCA.
  - **Cluster Size Plot**: See how many stocks belong to each cluster.
  - **Adjusted Close Prices**: Line plot of stock prices over time.
  - **Cumulative Returns**: Visualize the cumulative returns of selected stocks.
  - **Correlation Heatmap**: Show correlation between stock movements.
  - **PCA Biplot**: Visualize the PCA components and the clustering.

## Known Issues
- Some stocks might not be available for the entire date range, which could result in incomplete data.
- PCA-based clustering may not always provide optimal results for every stock combination.
